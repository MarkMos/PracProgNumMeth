\section{The exercise}
My exercise is to use the differential equation for arctan to write an arctan function.
This differential equation is
\begin{equation}
  \text{arctan}(x)' = \frac{1}{x^2 + h} \qquad , \qquad \text{arctan}(0)=0.
\end{equation}
My function should be compared to the function from math.h or GSL.

\section{Solving the Exercise}
I solve the exercise by using the GSL ODE solver. I define my ODE function in the
way required by GSL.
I then define an arctan function, which should integrate the ODE and return the
value at the endpoint, an x-value provided when calling my arctan function,
making it work just like calling the math.h arctan.

The ODE system contains just a single ODE, the dimension is thus 1. I do not use a jacobian or any further params.
I define a suitable precision and accuracy, in this case I define both as $10^{-6}$.
Now I just have to allocate a driver, in this gase I use a GSL odeiv2 driver with a
rkf45 stepper. It is then applied, calculating a y-value, and then freed. The function
then returns this y-value.

My main function just consists of a for-loop calling my arctan function and the math.h arctan
for a series of x-values. These results, along with the x-values are sent to the standard output.

When the makefile is run, this data is saved in data.out. I use gnuplot to plot the data to both
an .svg and a .tex-file. The makefile then builds this report using the .tex plot.
